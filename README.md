When a mere leash just won't do.

This is a direct port of the animal harness from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)'s multiplayer. I have included two distinct options, with each option having different specific configurations to adjust to your liking.

This was just a quick project I figured I'd push out for anyone who wanted to replicated MWII's animal carry system, where selecting an execution/finishing move involving an animal would result in them being strapped onto the character's back with these. Because most vanilla GTA "hand" components are parachutes and rear wear, it only made sense to name these as such.

Do note that rigging the dogs did not allow for seamless weight animations on them. After exploring several options and vertex groups, the mesh still ended up deforming too substantially when weighting it to arm bones; thus, neither of the dog models provided will move dynamically (in other words, act as their own individual "beings").

This pack includes the following:
○ Coyote-Olive harness
⁍ Three configurations:
• With MW 2019/MWII Riley K-9 German Shepherd model
• Empty model fit for vanilla animals
• Collapsed/Unoccupied

○ Tactical Med Service harness
⁍ Two configurations:
• With BO6 German Shepherd K-9 model, outfitted with a face shield
• Collapsed/Unoccupied

BUGS:
For the enlarged vanilla harness, certain animal models will not fit properly. It's best to disable their collision and have them play static animations before attaching them to your character's SKEL_ROOT bone.

HOW TO INSTALL:
Each model is its own "hand" component. You can install them as replaces for vanilla models or as add-ons using HeySlickThatsMe's MPClothes mod, found here here.

If installing as an add-on, you will install (and rename if needed) each of them in the following directory:
mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks > mpclothes > dlc.rpf > x64 > models > cdimages > mpclothes_male.rpf
